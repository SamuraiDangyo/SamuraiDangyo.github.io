# Havoc engine
Gothic engine. Under heavy development.

- Written in C++17. 
- make() + unmake()
- Object oriented. No globals
- Source code. Never available to limit copypaste-culture
- Bug free movegenerator

## Background
I got tired of standard chess and wrote from scratch a new variant engine.
Gothic engine from scratch in a few days.

Havoc is improving rapidly as I find more speedups and tricks.
Right now it's much faster than Fairy-Max 5.0b.
But weaker.

I have decided never publish the source code. 
Mayhem will be my last open source contribution.
No Havoc source code will be made available. 
I might give binaries to testers. 
As I enjoy watching Havoc playing.

## Blitz 3+0 results vs Fairy-Max 5.0b:
